1.	Model validation tests a model’s accuracy on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well. Calibration adjusts the model’s output to align better with actual observed outcomes.
2.	Aesthetics are visual properties of the elements in the graph that can be mapped to data values. Common aesthetics include size, shape, color, and position.
3.	The first color pallet that goes from red to green is more effective for humans.
4.	a) Qualitative color scale: used to distinguish categories without intrinsic order,  b) Sequential color scale: Used for ordered data that progresses from low to high (ideal for showing gradients), c) Diverging color scale: Used for data that deviates around a median value, showing both positive and negative deviations, d) Accent color scale: Used to highlight specific elements within data that are particularly significant, using a mix of subtle and bold colors to draw attention to key data points.
5.	The three pillars of science are experiment/observations, theory/physical models, and computational/data-driven models.
6.	No, logical implication is not the same as physical causation. An example of this is such: it is raining, therefore it is cloudy. The rain did not physically cause the clouds.
7.	1) No, this is not a visually good fit, as it only follows the pattern of the 1970s onward, rather than taking in account the entire graph.
2) This is due to the limited availability and precision of historical data that was more difficult to track without the proper tools we have today.
3) This trend represents a positive correlation.
4) Yes, because it consists of sequences of values obtained at uniform intervals in successive points of time.
5) The average temperature anomaly over all dates computes to 0.070925 degrees.
8. The Bayesian school of probability theory allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge in scientific inference.
9. The frequentist school of probability is the most useful here because it does not take into consideration prior knowledge, but rather lets the data speak for itself.
10. The frequentist school of probability cannot discuss the probability of the existence of God because it relies on observing events in repeated trials to determine probabilities, and the existence of God cannot be tested or observed in this way.
11. The range of density values on the y-axis is significantly smaller than the range of ages on the x-axis. This is misleading as it can lead to misinterpretation of the data as it exaggerates the data visualization to make the differences appear more extreme.
12. Computers use integers (binary code), comprising of zeros and ones, for simplicity reasons, and because it is the easiest for computers to comprehend. If it only had one number, there would be no variation, so both allows for that.

17. Deductive and plausible reasoning. An example of deductive reasoning: It is raining, therefore it is cloudy. An example of plausible reasoning: it is cloudy, therefore it is plausible that it will rain.
18. The equal sign is used to denote equal truth value.

20. No, we cannot. Computers can't represent all real numbers because they have limited memory and data formats that only approximate real numbers within certain limits.
21. The answer is 1683. For this, I factored out the multiple of 3 to make the sequence now s=3(1+2+3+4+…+31+32+33). I then used the equation sum = n/2(a1+a3), which in this example is 33/2(1+33)=561. I then multiplied the result with the 3 that I had factored out, making s= 3(561), which equals 1683.
