1. Aesthetics are visual properties of the elements in the graph that can be mapped to data values. Common aesthetics include size, shape, color, and position.
2. Two major classes of aesthetics are positional aesthetics (for example, x, y positions) and nonpositional aesthetics (color, size, shape).
3. Two major types of data are quantitative, which represent quantities and include numbers, and qualitative, which represents categories or qualities.
4. The common name is categorical variables.
5. An example of ordered data is size of clothing (small, medium, large). AN example of unordered data is colors of cars.
6. Month is a qualitative, categorical, discrete, ordered factor. Day is a quantitative, numerical, discrete, ordered value. Location is a qualitative, categorical, discrete, unordered factor. Station ID is a qualitative, categorical, discrete, unordered factor. Temperature is a quantitative, numerical, continuous, ordered value.
7. Axes that represent similar types of data or those that inherently share the same unit and scale—like spatial dimensions (for example, length in x and y directions)—should be represented with the same units and grid size.
8. An example where transforming the axes of a plot improves visualization is when dealing with exponential growth data, such as population growth over time. By applying a logarithmic transformation to the y-axis, the exponential growth curve can be straightened, making trends easier to identify and compare visually.
9. All three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data.
10. Data sets that are inherently circular, such as directional data indicating wind or water currents, can be best visualized in polar coordinates
11. Sequential  color scales: Best for visualizing ordinal or quantitative data where the order of values is important. These scales often use gradually intensifying shades of a single color. 
Diverging color scales:  Ideal for data that deviates around a median value, highlighting both directions of deviation. These scales typically use two contrasting colors. 
Qualitative color scales: Suitable for categorical data where no order or ranking is implied among categories. These use distinctly different colors for each category. 
Cyclic color scales: Used for data that cycles through a range, such as angles or times of day. These scales loop back on themselves in a circular manner.  
12. The range of density values on the y-axis is significantly smaller than the range of ages on the x-axis. This is misleading as it can lead to misinterpretation of the data as it exaggerates the data visualization to make the differences appear more extreme.
13. The first color pallet that goes from red to green is more effective for humans.

    2) The average temperature of Duluth is 40 degrees, whereas Honolulu’s is 77 degrees; therefore, Honolulu is hotter on average than Duluth.
    3) The standard deviation of Duluth is 21.38 degrees, whereas Honolulu’s is 3.40 degrees; therefore, Duluth has a greater variance of temperature than Honolulu.
