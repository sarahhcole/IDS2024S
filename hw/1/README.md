4. a. Git pull: This command is used to pull the latest version of the repository onto your local repository, including any revisions that might have been made by other collaborators.  
   b. Git status: This command is used to check the status of the project.
   c. Git add --all: This command is used to add files to the staging area.
   d. Commit m"latest build": This command is used to commit staged files to the local repository. The -m command allows you to add a message to be pairded with this commit.
   e. Git push -all: This command is used to push the changes made to the local repository onto the remote repository.
