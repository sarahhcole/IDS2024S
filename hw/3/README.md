1. The three pillars of science are experiment/observations, theory/physical models, and computational/data-driven models.  
2.	One application is predictive computing, which involves a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction. An example of this in use is stroke imaging. Another application is numerical simulation, which is a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available. Another is data-driven discovery via machine and deep learning. An example of this is detecting cars on the road. 
3.	Deductive and plausible reasoning. An example of deductive reasoning: It is raining, therefore it is cloudy. An example of plausible reasoning: it is cloudy, therefore it is plausible that it will rain.
4.	It is raining;  therefore it is cloudy.
5.	If the police man hears a burglar alarm, and he sees the man crawling out of the window with a bag of stolen jewelry, then it is plausible that he is dishonest.
