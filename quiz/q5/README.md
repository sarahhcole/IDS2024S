1.	Aesthetics are visual properties of the elements in the graph that can be mapped to data values. Common aesthetics include size, shape, color, and position.
2.	Two major classes of aesthetics are positional aesthetics (for example, x, y positions) and nonpositional aesthetics (color, size, shape).
3.	Factors refer to categorical variables used in plots, and levels are the different categories or unique values within a factor. For example, in a plot showing car sales, "brand" might be a factor while the specifics car brands such as Ford, Toyota, etc. would be the levels.
4.  Two major types of data are quantitative, which represent quantities and include numbers, and qualitative, which represents categories or qualities. An example of quantitative data is age, and an example of qualitative data is types of cars.
5.	Factors.
6.	An example of ordered data is size of clothing (small, medium, large). An example of unordered data is colors of cars.
7.	Data involving angles, rotations, or periodic phenomemena, such as wind direction over a day, are best visualized in polar coordinates.
8.	Qualitative color scales are used to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map. Sequential scales are used for a quantitative data that progresses from low to high, which is good for showing magnitudes. Diverging scales are used for quantitative data with critical midpoint, like temperature changes from a baseline. Accent color scales contain both a set of subdued colors and a matching set of stronger, darker, and/or more saturated colors.
9.	3D plots are often avoirded because they can cause misinterpretation of data due to obscured views and complexity in the understanding of the spatial relationship between the data points.
10.	Something that could be classified as either numerical or categorical is clothing size which could either be represented as a physical number (for example, size 7, size 7.5, size 8, etc), or it could be represented as categorical (for example, small, medium, large).
11.	Color is a categorical/unordered aesthetic.
12.	All three charts are valid and can be used to represent data.
13.	The first color pallet that goes from red to green is more effective for humans.
14.	a) Chicago, b) Death Valley, c) Chicago, d) San Diego
15. a) qualitative color scale, b) Sequential color scale, c) diverging color scale d) accent color scale.
16. An accent color scale was used for this model.
17. The highest number on the vertical axis is lower than the highest bar in the chart, making it look messy and difficult to read.
